## Predicting finger flexion using intracranial EEG / ECoG (4th BCI Competition problem)

Revisiting my BE521 Final Project from Spring 2016. 

The task is to develop an algorithm to use the ECoG to predict finger flexion that is captured by the Data Glove

The Dataset is taken from the IEEG portal and contains 3 subjects. Data is split up as follows: 

1. Training ECoG
2. Training Data Glove
3. Testing ECoG

My goals for this project are to first understand the dataset and properly document my testing. Also hoping to gain more experience with neuroscience, feature extraction, signal processing, unsupervised learning, supervised learning, and prediction. Another goal is to convert this project into python and make use of python machine learning and data science tools.
